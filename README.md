Hey this repo is made for the sole reason to keep track of my python-django projects.
It contains multiple app/sites in a single repo as i don't as these projects are mainly 
for learning purpose and are small scale project.

There is alsp python environment included in this repo for ease of use and convinience.
As i don't have to switch the directory to often for now.

Also this is only for small scale project i created for learning , testing and exprimenting.
As this projects are meant for runned only on local device.

I will be creating a separate repo for internship project.
